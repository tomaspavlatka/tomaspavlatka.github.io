Hi, I’m Tomas – a Senior Backend Engineer with 15+ years of experience in software development. I specialize in designing and optimizing high-performance, scalable systems that drive business growth.

Over the last years, I contributed to projects impacting millions of orders in the Wayfair Warehouse network. My work included supporting ongoing operations, improving customer-driven enhancements, implementing tools to boost engineering velocity, and leading the transition from a monolith to microservices.

## What I bring to the table:

- **Scalable System Architecture** – From Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions to e-commerce platforms, I build infrastructure that enables growth.
- **Problem-Solving at Scale** – Reduced data discrepancies by 90%, led CI/CD improvements, and enhanced system reliability.
- **Collaboration & Leadership** – Having worked across 3 countries with people from 17+ nationalities, I adapt quickly and foster innovation.
- **Mentorship & Hiring** – I interview and mentor senior engineers and team leads to help build strong technical teams.

As a father of five, I know how to handle pressure, adapt to challenges, and stay focused on results. I’m always looking to connect with like-minded professionals passionate about scalable software solutions and impactful engineering.
