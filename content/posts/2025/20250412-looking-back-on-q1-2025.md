I am already deep in April, but I own it to myself to have a look back on first 3 months of this year (2025). Let's pay the debt to myself and do this. 

## Work

Let's have a look on the work as I spend quite a lot of time there.

### Easypay 

We continued to work on our own buy-now-pay-later solution, internally called easypay. We continued our work to bring everything itno life in our new shiny SaaS platform.

I enjoyed working with Taha and Klaudia and finally see things being used, even though only on testing. Finance people continued to do their own part in discussing with the finance people ensuring that we have finance partner to work with.

### Other

We also had our 1st quarterly office week. It was actually good to be back in the office for a moment. I do not think I would like to go the every week as it really take time to get there and to come back home, but one week in 3 months, I can commit to that. 

## Personal

I started to dive deeper into AWS ecosystem. I put a goal to myself to be certified engineer. I had a look into the [AWS Certification Paths](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) and decided to follow Application Architect path. I love to take things step by step, so I signed up for 1st exam on this path - Cloud Practitioner.

It took little conviencing of people that this exam is important to me as they thought it's very basic and could be skipped. After studying for a week, I would not say this is very basic, as some of the question are really difficult to answer and there is a lot of materials to go through. The exam is set to the last day of April 2025, so hopefully I will have a great news to share in my next look-back post.

I also persuaded my passion for Linux and I finally switch from Mac to Arch Linux. It has been a great journey so far, full of learning and excitement at the same time.
