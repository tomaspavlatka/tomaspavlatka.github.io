One of the saying goes like this. _The end of one journey is a beginning of another one._

After more than 2 years at [zolar](https://zolar.com/), it is time to say THANK YOU and explore another challenges, this time at [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/). But let's take it easy.

**Initial thought**

It must have been the beginning of this year when I started to play with an idea of job switching. I am not a person who likes to switch the jobs, though I know it's very common in the field I work in, but I am old school, who likes to finish what he starts. At the end, we all were created in God's image and our God is God of IT IS FINISHED, not of almost or half done. And I carry the same mentality. Unfortunately, or fortunately (I am not sure), the project I spent my last 2 years working on was discontinued so it gave me free-pass to try things out.

I also heard that today's market is very difficult and what is the best way to validate things you hear than to put it in test, right? So I started to apply for jobs and I found out exactly what is being said - it is actually very hard. I do not want to scare anyone as I believe that there is a right job for everyone. _Please keep trying and never loose your hope._ What I am trying to say is that you need to be more patient than years ago.

I know that I am a simple engineer, but I have a word for any recruiter who might be reading this. Please treat us with same respect we treat you. It takes time for us to apply, fill forms and answer questions. Even if we are not the right match, drop us the message and do not leave us waiting forever. Thank you.

**GetYourGuide saga**

Out of countless applications I submitted, I also applied for position at GetYourGuide. My ex-colleage [Ana-Maria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anakadar/) works there, so I asked her for a referral. Today's market is tough, so you should use any advantage you can to increase a chance to be even invited for the intial interview. Yes, nowadays, even the invitation for intial interview is a win. I got contacted by [Dulce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dulce-luna-990a0463/) and interview process started. I have to say that the interview process is intense, but it's very well prepared and handled. They are 7 rounds I had to go through, but before each round, I was given a clear instructions what to expect and how to prepared well for it. 

I truly believe that everyone must take time and prepare himself/herself for interview. There might be some super-stars who can simply show-up and excel, but I am not one of them. Especially when you are asking for 100k+ job, you should show that you deserve it.

The process took little bit longer than expected, especially because it went through easter holidays, but I enjoyed every single round. I was privilege to meet wonderful people during these rounds and have a great conversation. The extra benefit of interviews like this is that I could reflect on my career so far and think about projects I was part of - regardless of their outcome.

The final decision came and it was positive. It was followed by the offer, which I gladly accepted. It is start to look forward what new challenges are there. Paul said it like this - but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead. GetYourGuide, here I am, let's create history together.

**Thank you, zolar**

Though I have to say goodbye to zolar, I am leaving with a lot of memories and learnings. It was great 2-years ride, not always smooth, but always exciting. I met great people - I do not want to mention anyone so I will not forget anyone, but you know who I am talking about. I still believe and pray that zolar will make it and will we big. The market is tough, but you are all wonderful engineers, bound by common vision and passion for your job. You never know, the world is too small place, maybe our roads will cross again and we will join our forces to shape a company future together.

It was my privilege to work with all of you and I am forever grateful for all you shared with me and I could learn from you.
