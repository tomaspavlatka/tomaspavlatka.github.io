One simple sentence and the impact is huge. I spoke with our IT guy and then I was asked why I chose Mac OS, when everyone would expect me to use linux. Which was actually a correct thought. I primarily use Neovim and conssole applications, but got stuck on Macbook for so long.

Thought took deeper roots and I decided to do a switch. I had to get all the approvals, but it was quite easy. Company wants to have happy employees and therefore we are the owners of our destinies. There are no limitations and therefore the road was open.

I made the list of apps I definitely need and started the journey. I also chose Arch Linux as my main distribution. I wanted the full experience and also have a colleague who is a long time Arch Linux user (since 1999). 

I also had to chose desktop environment to use. I checked couple of them and XFCE was the winner. I love the simplicity and the resource management. 
## Applications I need

- neovim
- tmux
- terminal
- mail client
- zoom
- okta
- slack
- web browser
- 2nd monitor support
- bluetooth headphones
