![Keyboardio Model 01](/img/keyboardio-model-01.jpeg)
I like to try new things, I love to take on a new challenge. And using split keyboard was and is one of my todo list for a while now. I have tried ti many times in the past, only to find myself going back to normal keyboard every time. I do not like this, I do not like when I set a goal for myself and I fail. Regardless of what the actual reason for the failure is, it must not stop me from trying even harder next time.

So as my x-attempt, I will do my best to not fail this time. 

To begin with, I feel comfortable to write normal letters on the keyboard, my challenge comes when coding in vim. After many years in vim ecosystem, my muscle memory is pretty good. Unfortunately, having split keyboard put this memory in great test. 

My keyboard for this test is [Keyboardio Model 01](https://shop.keyboard.io/), which I borrowed from my friend [Jay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamayne-c/) as it was just collectidg dust in his office. I think this keyboard bring extra challenge for this switch due to its special keycaps position, but ... go big or go home, right?

So what is the gameplan? For next 30 days, I will use the Keyboardio Model 01 as my primary keyboard. No matter what I do, no matter when I go, the keyboard goes with me and serves me. I will not fallback to my other keyboard and as long as the condition permits, I will also not use a built-in keyboard on my Mac. I also hate it.
